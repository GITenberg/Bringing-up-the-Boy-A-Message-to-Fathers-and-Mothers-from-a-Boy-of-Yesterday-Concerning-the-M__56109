<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>
</div>


<p>A good portion of the material in this
volume was printed in serial form in <cite>The
Delineator</cite>, to whose editors and publishers
I am deeply indebted for the sympathy
and encouragement that were necessary to
bring my ideas on boy training into the
circle of general parenthood. As a result
of the publicity gained through the medium
of that magazine’s wide circulation, many
letters were received by the magazine and
by myself; and in this mass of correspondence
there was a distinct note of appeal
for the publication of the essays between
covers. It was quite without any knowledge
of this demand, however, that the
present publishers, acting independently,
became interested in the series, and decided,
after due consideration, to issue it
in book form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>It was surprising that of the many letters
received while these articles were appearing
serially, only a small minority of
the writers disagreed with my views, and
those few protests were confined to one
or two subjects. So far as could be reasonably
expected of one whose time is
much occupied in pursuing a livelihood, I
replied to all such communications. If in
some instances I failed, the omission was
not because I was lacking in a keen appreciation
of the interest, the sympathy, the
suggestions and the criticisms thus expressed.
As to those who disagreed with
me, I would like to repeat here what I
have said to them in personal replies:
They may be right, and I wrong. This
much only, I know—That Providence is
kind in that He permits me to retain a distinct
picture of the boy’s cosmos; that as
a man and a father I can still see—and
feel—from the boy’s viewpoint; and that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
preserving that visuality, I have tried,
with the best judgment and most constant
effort of which I am capable, to employ
it for the greatest good. Everything that
I have written about boy training is
solidly fixed on this foundation; and everything
that I have written has been or is
being employed, to the very letter, in my
stewardship of one who is infinitely more
precious to me than life itself—my own
boy. If I have erred, may God forgive
me; but on this score my conscience is as
clear as a crystal pool, for so far as human
vision penetrates not one duty has been
left undone and not one endeavour has
gone astray. And happily, though I say
it with a prayer on my lips and humility
in my heart, every passing year adds its
living testimony to the principles which I
advocate and for which I plead.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a><br />
<small>FROM BABY TO BOY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Your son, madam, while passing a vacant
house, paused, poised his arm and deliberately
sent a small stone crashing through
one of the windows. Then, turning on his
heel, he ran nimbly up the street and disappeared
around the corner.</p>

<p>You know it occurred, because some
one living next to the house saw him do
it and told the owner, and the owner came
to you for reparation and you charged the
boy with it and he admitted it to be true.</p>

<p>You are heartbroken because you find
yourself confronted with what appears to
be irrefutable evidence that your son is a
bad boy.</p>

<p>You ask him why he did it. He doesn’t
know. You suggest that it might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
been an accident. Being a truthful boy, he
replies tearfully that it was not. You enquire
if he had any grievance against the
man who owns the house. He answers
that he hadn’t even heard of the owner
and didn’t know who he was. Then—you
ask again—why did he do it? You get the
same answer:</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>It certainly looks dubious for your boy,
madam, doesn’t it? If at the tender age of
ten years a lad will deliberately “chuck” a
stone through a neighbouring window, with
no reason or provocation for it whatsoever,
what may he not be capable of
at twenty? The thought is appalling,
isn’t it?</p>

<p>Happily, however, I think it can be
demonstrated to your complete satisfaction
that your son is not bad—so far as this
particular offence is concerned, anyway—and
that this stone-throwing business is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
perfectly natural thing for a perfectly normal
boy to do.</p>

<p>To start with, let us suppose that I have
placed on your back fence, side by side,
a brick and a bottle. I then hand you a
little target-rifle and invite you to try your
skill at shooting. Now, which will you
aim at—the brick or the bottle?</p>

<p>The bottle, of course. You answer
more quickly than I can write it.</p>

<p>And why the bottle?</p>

<p>Just think that over a moment, please.
Why the bottle?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let us go back to the boy
and the window.</p>

<p>The desire to see a physical result from
any personal effort is deep-seated in every
human being. Where is the author who
does not take secret and real pleasure in
scanning the achievements of his pen in
the public print? Where is the architect
who would forego the pleasure of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the finished structure, the lines and masses
of which he has dreamed over and designed?
The desire to see the result follow
the endeavour, the effect follow the
cause, is strong within us all.</p>

<p>It may seem a far cry from art and letters
to the boy and the broken window,
but the psychologic principle involved is
one and the same. The boy, sauntering
along the street or the roadway, has been
amusing himself by throwing stones. He
has sent one against the side of a barn
with no effect other than the sound of a
hollow thud as it struck the boards. He
has heaved one at a telegraph pole, and
the pole didn’t even quiver. Then he
spies the vacant house.</p>

<p>It is obviously deserted and abandoned.
A pane already shattered in one of the
windows starts the idea. It is far enough
back from the street to make the throw
a test of skill. If he misses there’s no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
harm done. If he hits there’ll be a noise,
a crash, a shower of flying glass and—Enough!
Up goes the arm, away goes the
stone with fateful accuracy and the deed
is done. It was the act of a sudden impulse.
Before the conscience within him
could assert itself the missile had struck;
and that innate human ambition to produce
a visible result was gratified.</p>

<p>The deed is done, and the boy doesn’t
know why he did it. But returning to
the hypothesis of the brick and the bottle,
perhaps you, madam, can explain why you
would prefer to shoot at the bottle.</p>

<p>In these talks I want to tell mothers
something of what I know about boys; not
all about them, but just a few of the more
vital things that every mother of a boy
ought to know and every father ought
to be reminded of. I say “reminded”
advisedly, for the fathers must have
known some time, though it would seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that most of them have forgotten now.
What I say I know about boys, I know.
What I may suggest or advise is another
matter. It can stand only as a belief, an
opinion, and my sole excuse for presuming
to offer it is that I love the boy;
I live close to him and I believe in
him.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the intuitiveness
generally accredited to motherhood is in
the least degree overestimated or exaggerated.
But mere intuitiveness, even in
its highest form of development, can
hardly be expected to bridge the natural
gap of temperamental sex difference between
mother and son.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the father, not eager
to invade what he believes to be the
mother’s sphere, usually is content to leave
the management of the boy in the mother’s
hands, while the mother, not recognising
the deficiency of her position, labours on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
patiently, lovingly, untiringly, but in many
cases blindly, and often with poor success.
If mothers only understood this it would
be better. If they could be brought to
realize the handicap under which they are
striving they could fortify themselves
against it. They could deepen the interest
of the father or, failing that, they
could at the least draw upon his experience
and knowledge of real boyhood with
good effect. But there are no sex distinctions
to the average mother. The
boys and the girls are just “the children”
and the difference of sex is lost in the
great catholicity of maternal love.</p>

<p>At the very beginning parents must concede
the existence of an inherent temperamental
difference between the boy and the
girl. This, for the mother, is not so easy
of adjustment as it may appear. The boy
is her baby, just her baby, from swaddling-clothes
to long trousers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact is, of course, that the assertion
of the sex temperament starts almost
with the beginning of life. For the first
four or five years it is, to be sure, almost
a negligible quantity, but after that the
boy needs to be treated as a boy, and not
as a sexless baby.</p>

<p>Put a pair of new red shoes on a little
girl’s feet and send her out among a group
of misses shod in black. Then watch her
plume herself and pose at the front gate
and mince up and down the avenue, as
proud as a peacock.</p>

<p>Now, rig up the six-year-old boy in some
new and untried kink of fashion and turn
him loose on the highway—and observe
what follows. Note how sheepishly he
looks down the street to where his playfellows
are gathered, and see how he
edges toward them, faltering and keeping
as close to the fence as he can. Observe
how, just as he is trying to slip into their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
midst unostentatiously, one of them cries
in a shrill voice:</p>

<p>“Look who’s here!” and another remarks:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a shine!” and still another
exclaims:</p>

<p>“Pipe the kelly!” meaning, observe
the hat.</p>

<p>Then perhaps there is the very rude
boy who asks whether the “rags” have
been “rassled,” said enquiry being gently
emphasised by a push from behind. In
which case the young glass of fashion, having
a gloomy premonition of what may
happen to him at home if he returns
bearing the marks of combat, backs discreetly
off the firing-line, and retreats to
his own dooryard with as small loss of
dignity as the exigency of the occasion
will permit. And he is pretty sure to stick
there the remainder of the afternoon,
while occasionally other boys, in regulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
woollens or corduroys, peep at him
curiously through the palings, making him
feel like one of those unpronounceable
animals that they keep in cages and lecture
about at the zoo.</p>

<p>Do you think this characteristic of the
boy really signifies that he is “notional”?
Do you put it down merely as “finicality”?
Then you do him a great injustice.
In the true analysis it is quite the opposite.
It is but one feature of a unique
democracy, a splendid democracy that you
will find holding sway wherever boys
gather. Oh, this democracy of boyhood
is a wonderful thing! To me it is the
régime beautiful. There is something so
inspiring about it! For here, in this
quaint domain of dare-and-do, you see
every sturdy little chap, regardless of
clothes, creed or family position, standing
on his own merits and judged by his
own deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Why some mothers persist in Little-Lord-Fauntleroy-ing
their boys within an
inch of their lives is to me a profound
mystery. Can any mother enlighten me
on the long-curls cruelty? Is it selfish
vanity? Could any mother, for the mere
gratification of an egoistic desire, be so
unfeeling as to send her helpless boy out
into the scene of humiliation and actual
physical torture of which the boy with the
long curls becomes the pitiable centre as
soon as he turns the corner?</p>

<p>I do not like to think so. Rather would
I believe, as in the case of the broken window,
that the mother’s error is chargeable
to her never having been a boy. She
has a faulty conception of what it means
to be yanked about by those boy-hated
ringlets of gold, to be harassed and
taunted by the inornate but happier hoi
polloi.</p>

<p>I recall one afternoon when I took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
youngster of three around to the barber’s
to have him shorn. I returned with the
boy in one hand and the curls in the other.
He was magnificently cologned and
wanted everybody to “smell it.”</p>

<p>The mother was waiting with an empty
shoe-box in her lap. She was sitting by
the window, in the soft half-light of the
early evening, and she caressed the golden
bronze ringlets before putting them away.
And something glistened in her eye and it
fell into the box and was packed away
with the curls. I shouldn’t wonder if it
were there yet, for somehow I can’t help
thinking that a tear like that must crystallise
into a tiny pearl and glisten on forever.</p>

<p>But when this mother looked up at the
boy, she was smiling, almost proudly; and
she patted the shiny, round head, and
kissed it, cologne and all, and quoted a
verse about having “lost a baby and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gained a man,” declaring that he really
looked much better than she had expected.</p>

<p>And the boy was put to bed and slept
coolly and comfortably, and he’s had a
clean scalp and a clear conscience ever
since, I guess.</p>

<p>But here I am, taking up the reader’s
precious time talking about clothes and
curls—neither of which mere man is supposed
to know anything about—when all
I meant to do was to emphasise the fact
that long before a half-dozen of his birthdays
have been celebrated, the boy must
be taken up as an abstract proposition.</p>

<p>At the age of five, then, let us say, the
boy reaches the stage of recognisable and
indisputable masculinity. This is the
logical time for the properly constituted
father to take the helm of the son’s destiny.
If he does not do so, through
lack of interest, lack of time or lack
of the faculty for it, the mother must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
needs go on with the struggle. Her five
years of training the baby will not come
amiss in training the boy. But she must
now reckon with boyhood as a distinct
classification of childhood. She must remember
that from now on, every year,
every month, every day, widens the gap of
sex divergence. She will do well to look
at the bearded men who pass her door and
consider that every attribute of masculinity
exists, embryonically, in her round-faced
baby boy.</p>

<p>From now on, if she hopes to appeal
to the best that is in him, she must not
only study the boy, but she must study
the world from the boy’s viewpoint. The
nearer the mother can get to the boy’s
inner emotions, the more effectively can
she direct the trend of his mental, moral
and physical development. Herein lies
the secret of getting and keeping a grip
on the boy.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a><br />
<small>THE SIMPLICITY OF DISCIPLINE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>We are living in an epoch of extremists.
This morning the suffering dyspeptic is
told that he will find a complete cure in
a two weeks’ fast; this afternoon he is
advised that by eating every two hours
he will be forever free from his ills. On
the one hand is a sect preaching that
prayer will bring us peace, power and
plenty, and on the other is a schism pleading
that supplication, in itself, availeth
nothing. Here we have a group of modern
disciplinists teaching that corporal
punishment is a fading relic of barbaric
brutality; there we find a sturdy
school of old-timers telling us that if
we spare the rod we shall spoil the
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>With these extremists who specialise in
the stomach or in the soul I have no quarrel;
but coming down to the subject of
disciplining the boy I do want to point out
to fathers and mothers seriously and earnestly
that there is a happy medium, a
middle course—a neutral and natural
way.</p>

<p>The moral suasion idea is a fine thing
in theory and it would be a moderately
fine thing actually if parents were all
moral suasionists, and if parents and children
had nothing else in the world to do
but practise it. By this I mean that if
all or most parents were naturally
equipped to rule by moral suasion, and,
secondly, if twenty-four hours of the day
could be devoted exclusively to discipline,
it would be undoubtedly a commendable
method of child-government. Unfortunately,
such is not the case, and in dealing
with the question collectively we have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
take conditions, parents and children as
we find them.</p>

<p>Nearly every parent possesses the
faculty of governing to some extent—greater
or less; and all children are capable
of responding to it—but in varying
degrees. There is, therefore, no hard
and fast rule that can be laid down for
the guidance of all parents, to be applied
successfully to all children. However, by
reducing the subject of this article first
to boys, and second to the average boy,
I think we can get the discussion down
to a practicable basis. The little girl is
here absolutely eliminated from consideration.
I have studied her assiduously and
at close range for a number of years and
have succeeded in establishing this much
only; first, that she is almost too sweetly
complex for paternal comprehension, and
second, that she is not amenable to the
rules by which we discipline the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>My boy, then, is the average boy, old
enough to walk and talk and understand
what is said to him, moderately sensitive,
moderately affectionate, moderately impulsive,
moderately perverse, of ordinarily
good health, and possessed of the
usual amount of animal spirits.</p>

<p>Obedience is the foundation stone of
the entire structure of discipline. There
is a good deal in discipline besides obedience,
but without obedience there is no
discipline. It is not the alpha and omega,
but is a good deal more than the alpha.
Discipline is harmony. Harmony cannot
be maintained without perfect obedience,
because obedience is a joint affair, a partnership
arrangement between you and the
boy. All other essentials of discipline are
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex parte</i>. In all other essentials you are
subjective and the boy is objective. You
think and he acts, you direct and he executes,
you furnish the plan of living and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he lives it. But it is the <em>partnership</em> in
obedience that makes this possible. Given
perfect obedience, the rest is easy, because
the boy’s daily routine is simply a vivification
of the principles shaped by your own
matured mind.</p>

<p>Let me repeat, then, that discipline is
simply harmony and harmony cannot be
attained without perfect obedience. Note
the adjective, <em>perfect</em>, for this is the obstacle
over which we are so prone to
stumble. Obedience must be absolute,
complete and infallible.</p>

<p>How can we attain it? How can we
take the child-boy and so mould him that
he will respond to a command instantly
and unfailingly? Within him there is a
natural, healthy instinct opposed to it.
Within him is the natural human tendency
to think and act independently, to learn
by experiment, to venture unassisted and
unrestrained into the unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Punishment other than corporal will
not always do it, because at the time when
this condition must be established the boy’s
baby mentality is not capable of compassing
the long distances between cause and
effect. At the early age at which it is
necessary to establish perfect obedience,
the moral penalties are too slow in action,
too complex and too much dependent upon
local condition to be effective. There are
exceptions, of course. For example: You
have a box of sweets and you tell the boy
he may take one. He takes two. As a
penalty for his disobedience you make him
return both pieces to the box and you cast
the package into the fire. There you have
incorporal punishment that is instant, direct
and effective; but this incident is made
to order and of rare occurrence in fact.
Suppose that the boy swallows the two
pieces instantly, or suppose the more usual
occurrence that you have forbidden him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to partake of the sweets at all and he has
surreptitiously eaten one. What then?
Casting the remainder into the fire will
not impress him at the time because his
appetite has been satisfied, the desire is
dulled. You may deprive him of his allowance
on the day following, but the lapse
of time dims the relation of the penalty
to the offence. This kind of treatment
works well with some of the minor errors
but not with disobedience. The tendency
to disobey is too constant, too persistent
and too frequent, and too early in the
boy’s process of development.</p>

<p>A mother said: “It is not necessary
for me to strike my child. I compel him
to sit in a chair for one hour without
speaking. He fears that more than the
rod.” Of course, he does, poor little
chap! And that mother did not realise
that she was substituting a barbaric torture
for mild punishment. I reverse her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
reasoning: It is not necessary for me to so
torture my boy. Nor shall I deprive him
of his play, of the outside air, of his supper,
of anything that makes for his health
and happiness, nor of any good thing that
it is in my power to give him.</p>

<p>Disobedience calls for a punishment
that is short, direct and impressive. A
sharp tap on the palm of a boy’s hand,
or on the calf of his leg—or two or five
or ten—is the only kind of penance I know
of that fills the requirements. It is the one
short and sure road to an immediate result.
Naturalists tell us that the sense of
touch is the first experienced by a newborn
child. It is the first and quickest wire
from the outer world to the brain. Then
come hearing and smelling and seeing and
long after these come the moral perceptions,
the power of deduction and the distinction
of right and wrong. My experience
has been that this first sense continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
to be the live wire until well on toward
the maturity of the child—if the child is
a boy. There are many men, who can
undergo the severest mental torture with
calm resolution and fortitude, but who
tremble at the sight of a dental chair.
Not long ago I was chatting with a friend,
who is a dentist, when a burly policeman
rushed in, plumped himself into the operating-chair
and asked the dentist to ease his
aching tooth. The dentist looked at the
tooth and reached for his forceps. “The
only way to fix that is to extract it,” he
said. The officer of the law sprang from
the chair like a jack-in-the-box and made
for the door, remarking apologetically as
he went out that he couldn’t spare the
time. “That man,” said the dentist, when
he had gone, “has a medal for bravery,
and three times has been commended for
saving lives at the risk of his own.”</p>

<p>It is not that the boy fears pain, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
that he fears the certainty of it, he dreads
the deliberate, the inevitable punishment,
accompanied by no moral stimulus with
which to combat it. I have known my
boy to take a severe beating from another
boy in a struggle for the possession of
an apple—and all without shedding a tear.
The spat on the hand that I inflicted was
a mere flea-bite to that beating, but because
of it I could leave an apple within
reach of his hand indefinitely and, though
he might want it ever so much, he would
not touch it if I had forbidden him.</p>

<p>So much for the psychology of corporal
punishment. Now for the practice of it.</p>

<p>While I may have been guilty of many
literary offences, a list of “Don’ts” has
not, up to this time, been among them.
But as the word obedience necessarily captions
an imposing array of “Don’ts” for
the boy, I think his parents may be better
equipped to enforce them by considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
some very important ones applying to
themselves. At any rate, having spoken
freely in favour of the use of the rod, it
is vitally important to qualify my advocacy
of it in accordance with my experience
and belief. Every one of the qualifications
or conditions that I am about to enumerate
is essential to this system of discipline,
so much so that if they were not to be considered
as part of it, all that I have written
would go for naught and I would ask
to withdraw it completely.</p>

<p>Corporal punishment is resorted to for
one kind of offence only—disobedience.
Absolutely for no other.</p>

<p>Corporal punishment consists of a few
sharp taps on the palm or calf with a thin
wood ruler.</p>

<p>The boy is never punished in the presence
of a third person, even a brother or
sister.</p>

<p>Punishment is never administered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the slightest sign of anger or under excitement.
<em>Any parent incapable of so administering
corporal punishment should
not employ it.</em></p>

<p>Punishment must partake of the nature
of a simple ceremony rather than of a
torture; it must be regarded as a duty,
not as a personal retaliation.</p>

<p>Punishment is always prefaced with a
simple, brief, but explicit explanation, like
this: “My boy, listen: I love you and I
do not like to hurt you. But, every boy
<em>must</em> be made to obey his father and
mother, and this seems to be the only way
to make you do it. So remember! Every
time you disobey me you shall be punished.
When I tell you to do a thing, you
must do it, instantly; without a moment’s
delay. If you hesitate, if you wait to be
told a second time, you will be punished.
When I speak, you must act. Just as sure
as you are standing here before me, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
punishment will follow every time you do
not do as you are told.”</p>

<p>Say no more than that. Drive home
the inseparability of the cause and the consequence;
let the idea of instant, infallible
obedience be telegraphed to his brain
simultaneously with the sting of the ruler.</p>

<p>Have no fear that this form of chastisement
will break your boy’s spirit or will
weaken the bond of love between him and
yourself. Both will be strengthened by
it. For one punishment inflicted, there are
hundreds of kind words and deeds to
prove your affection.</p>

<p>No child should be punished corporally
other than as I have described.</p>

<p>To strike him in the face, to strike him
at all with the hand or fist is brutal, and
brutality is not only sinful but ineffective.
Corporal punishment inflicted impulsively
is dangerous because it lacks the earmarks
of good intent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Above all, remember this: That the
kind of corporal punishment which I employ
is effective, first because it is the only
kind the child knows, and in no other way
does he feel the weight of a corrective
hand; and second, because <em>it never fails to
follow the deed</em>.</p>

<p>To waver is unfair to the child. Yesterday
he was punished. To-day he commits
the same infraction and is not punished.
Here is inconsistency and the boy
is confused. If it were not deserved to-day,
he reasons, it was undeserved yesterday;
therefore, he is aggrieved. Every
time you miss the atonement you lose a
link, and the chain of your discipline is
broken.</p>

<p>This is the chief error of parent disciplinarians.
We fail to grasp the all-important
truth that the unfailing application
of corporal punishment is the very
thing that can render punishment of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
kind unnecessary. Many a boy is punished
a hundred times where but a few
would have sufficed had the penalty been
exacted consistently and unfailingly. The
right kind of discipline neither spoils the
child nor spoils the rod. It spares both.
It is like good dentistry. Every moment
of hurt saves years of suffering in later
life. And good painless discipline is as
rare as good painless dentistry.</p>

<p>Further than this I have but little to
say about discipline, for, once you have
achieved infallible obedience, you are
bound to achieve perfect discipline. The
two words are synonyms in effect. No
mother can hope for the best results if
she seeks to train her boy as she would
arrange her hair—to please her vanity—or
as she would plan a shopping tour—to
suit her convenience. Self must be submerged
and the child’s future kept uppermost.
For discipline is a mother’s duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to her boy. If she falters in it the boy
will suffer. And every penalty that the
unwatched boy escapes through a parent’s
frailty, he will have to pay, many fold, in
the future years.</p>

<small>AS THE TWIG IS BENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>You hear the sound of sobbing in the distance,
and as it draws nearer and grows
more distinct you recognise the voice. A
moment later the door flies open and there
stands your boy, crying as though his heart
would break. Little rivulets of tears are
trickling down his dust-covered cheeks, and
on the side of his face is the mark of a
cruel blow.</p>

<p>Between sobs he tells you that the boy
across the street did it. Why? He doesn’t
know why; he wasn’t doing anything at
all, “jes’ playin’ around.”</p>

<p>You wipe the tears away and kiss the
hurt, and as you note the quivering lip
and the angry bruise, a wave of indignation
swells within you. Glancing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
through the window you see the boy across
the street, cavorting triumphantly on the
curb. How much bigger and coarser and
rougher than your boy he appears—isn’t
it always so? Your little chap has come
to you partly for sympathy, but mainly for
retaliation. He shows you his wound and
points to the boy who did it. He has been
hurt, he has been grievously wronged, and
he has come to you whom he has learned
to look upon as his one never-failing protector
and friend. You spring to your
feet, fired with an overwhelming desire
to rush into the street and avenge
the wrong that has been done your
child.</p>

<p>Madam, one moment! Don’t do it.
The retaliation you contemplate may be
justice so far as the tormentor across the
street is concerned, but it is a rank injustice
to your own boy. I want to tell you
on the authority of an ex-boy that if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
would serve your son best, you will not
interfere.</p>

<p>None but a mother knows the trials and
heartaches of the fighting period in a boy’s
life; and none but a father realises what
an important part that period plays in the
shaping of the boy’s career. The period
runs approximately from the ages of five
to ten. Prior to that the child is too young
to indulge in it, and subsequently he is too
old to tell about it. In the interim these
affairs of the street are of daily occurrence
and are to the mother a source of annoyance
as mysterious as they are harrowing.</p>

<p>The right way to deal with this problem
may not be the easiest way but it is
the simplest, and it is the best for the boy.
It is to let him alone. It is to teach him
from the very beginning that outside of his
own dooryard he must protect himself with
his own hands. Have a distinct understanding
that if he gets himself into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fight, he must get himself out of it. Tell
him that by helping him you would only
make more trouble for him because he
would get to be known as a coward, and
all the boys would annoy him more than
before.</p>

<p>I went further than this with my boy.
I told him that I did not approve of fighting,
but that if he were forced into it, I
would expect him to hit out hard and
fast and defend himself blow for blow. I
provided him with a punching-bag and a
set of boxing-gloves and I showed him
how to use them. He was just five when
I established this rule and in one year it
proved itself.</p>

<p>At six we started him off to school, and
a few days later he came home one afternoon
with a discoloured eye.</p>

<p>But there was no tear in it. He threw
his books in a corner and ran, whistling,
out to play. At dinner that evening my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
curiosity got the better of me, but I assumed
indifference.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the eye, old
chap?” I asked casually.</p>

<p>He looked up sheepishly, smiled and
pushed his cup toward me.</p>

<p>“Some more milk, if you please,
father,” he said. The fighting problem
had been solved forever.</p>

<p>The mother who coddles her boy shows
him a double unkindness. She not only
increases his boyhood miseries, through
making him the particular target of other
boys, but she retards the development of
his self-reliance and his manliness.</p>

<p>I give the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">affaire d’honneur</i> an important
place in this chapter because it is one
of the things about boys that mothers
often misunderstand and quite generally
undervalue.</p>

<p>Of course, the cardinal precept which
should form the foundation of the character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
structure is—Truth. Combine in
him manliness and truthfulness, and the
other essential traits of good character
will spring from these two like shoots from
the trunk of a healthy tree. Truth-telling
should be made a matter of habit with
the boy. Have you not among your acquaintances
men, women and children who
are habitual prevaricators, people who
make misstatements continuously, absolutely
without purpose and without malice?
Lying has become a habit with them. By
the same token truth-telling can be and
should be so instilled in the boy as to
become automatic. He should never be
punished for a falsehood as you might
punish him for disobedience. The problem
of disobedience, which I discussed in
a foregoing chapter, is a matter of psychology
from beginning to end. Truth-telling
becomes so in the end but is a matter
of morals at the beginning. It can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
formed into a fixed habit by treating it
morally and by keeping everlastingly at
it until the result is achieved. You cannot
beat a boy into hating a lie, but you
can shame him into it.</p>

<p>It is natural for a very young boy to seek
to evade responsibility for an offence by
disclaiming it. The first time he does this
he must be made to know that, however
serious the offence may be, it is as nothing
compared to the lie that he seeks to
cover. I did not go so far as to promise
my boy immunity for infractions that he
frankly confessed; but I did make it a
rule unto myself that he should never suffer
through confession, and I did invariably
commend him, in the highest terms,
when he told the truth under conditions
that made it peculiarly praiseworthy. An
example: I find my inkstand tipped over
and a great black stain upon the carpet.
I summon the boy and ask him sternly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
“Who did that?” My manner is threatening.
The offence is grave. He is thoroughly
frightened, but after a moment he
answers, falteringly, “I did.” Instantly
my attitude changes from admonitive to
commendatory. I say to him: “This is
an awful thing that you have done. The
carpet is spoiled. The stain will always
be there. Nothing can remove it. But
you have told the truth and that is the
finest thing that a boy can do. As bad as
this is, I would rather you would do it a
hundred times than tell one lie.”</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, he falsifies, I
grieve before him. I tell him that nothing
that a boy can do is as bad as a falsehood:
that a lie is the very meanest and
lowest thing in the world. I tell him that
I fully forgive him for spilling the ink, but
it is almost impossible to forgive him for
that lie. I leave him to meditate upon it.</p>

<p>I never allow an untruth to pass without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
bringing a blush of shame to the boy’s
cheek. I never let a lie show itself without
holding it up as a thing to be despised.
The boy first gets to fear a falsehood,
then to despise it—and finally to forget it.
And by forgetting I mean that it passes
beyond the pale of things considerable.
Truth has become a fixed habit.</p>

<p>Having accomplished this, you have
given your boy a solid foundation upon
which to rear the structure of good character.</p>

<p>I believe in sending the boy to the church.
Regardless of the parents’ attitude toward
religion, I believe it is their duty to give
the boy the benefit of a church environment
while he is still a boy. Irrespective
of sect or creed, he is sure to absorb some
good in an atmosphere of divine worship.
In later years he may depart from
the precepts there learned, but the early
teachings and associations of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or the Sunday school will leave their influence
in some degree, and whether it is
much or little, it will never be for anything
but good.</p>

<p>I give my boy the Bible to study and the
Golden Rule to live by. I teach him to
speak or think deprecatingly of no religious
faith, and show him that all are
working for the betterment of man.</p>

<p>From his infancy I guard him from
superstition and discourage the fear of
fancied dangers. I do not believe it is
necessary for a boy, at any age, to fear
the dark. Mine never did. Fear of the
dark is born of suggestion, and he has
been successfully guarded from any word
that would couple darkness with danger.
Throughout his entire childhood he never
sensed the usual terrors of the unlighted
room and the darkened passage. I would
never confirm even the Santa Claus myth,
though I did not dissuade him from it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
because I well remember the added joy it
brought to me when I was a boy. When
the question was put to me I said: “I shall
not tell you because the mystery of Christmas
adds much to your enjoyment of it.
Believe it or not, as you choose; I have
nothing to say.” With this pleasant exception
he has never asked me a question
that I have not answered truthfully and as
completely as I could.</p>

<p>I live close to my boy, and by so doing
I find his level and see his narrowed horizon
as he sees it. When he was only six
we lived together in the woods, slept under
the same blanket, fished and sailed and
took our daily swim together. Beginning
at that early age we have sat by the campfire
at night and talked of the stars and
the moon and the strange noises of the
wood. Nowhere can you get as close to
your boy as you can out under the sky with
only Nature about you. It would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
splendid thing if every father could devote
a few weeks each year to “roughing
it” with his boy. Besides the opportunities
it offers for community of thought, it
brings out a phase of the boy’s character
that under other conditions might never
come to the surface. I recall one evening,
as the boy and I were lolling on the bank
of a river, how he astonished me by exclaiming:
“See! What a beautiful sunset!”
He had seen the sun go down many
times over the housetops of the town, but
it needed the solitude of that particular
place and time to give him an appreciation
of its beauties. Unexpectedly there was
disclosed to me an æsthetic side of his
nature that I had never known.</p>

<p>These are opportunities that open peculiarly
to the father, and he should take
advantage of them.</p>

<p>I believe that every boy should be encouraged
to acquire a college education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and that he should be made to pay for it.
We hear a good deal of talk nowadays
about the lack of real advantage that the
college man has over the other fellow.
Thousands of college men fail in their
struggles with the work-a-day world, and
often you find a degree man working in a
subordinate capacity to a man of his own
age who missed a college education. It
is a fact, too, that the honour men of our
colleges rarely distinguish themselves in
their chosen professions. But none of
these things prove anything, because the
personal equation has to be reckoned in.
I believe that the young man who takes
his college course and takes it seriously is
better fitted for the work of life than he
would otherwise have been. The unschooled
man who succeeds would have
succeeded with more ease and to a higher
standard had he been schooled. The college
man who fails would have failed more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
miserably had he been untrained. I believe
that failure of an educated man is in
spite of his education, and not because
of it.</p>

<p>If you want to make sure that your boy
is going to use his college education to
the best advantage, let him pay his way.
The failures that our institutions of learning
turn out are not the men who work
their way through; they are the sons of
the affluent, the little brothers of the rich.
The boy who drives the hay-rake or works
behind the counter of his father’s store in
vacation time is rarely found among the
derelicts. Let the boy share the cost with
you, and you need have no fear that either
the time or money spent for education
will go for naught.</p>

<p>From the first time that he trots over
to the candy store with his penny, the
boy should be trained to know the intrinsic
value of money. Encourage him in moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
frugality, not because the accumulation
of money is a desideratum, but because
profligacy is bad for the morals.</p>

<p>Whether it is the mother or the father
who takes especial charge of the boy, or
both, they should aim steadfastly to have
his complete confidence always. He
should be made to feel that they are not
only dearer to him, but nearer to him
than any one else in the world.</p>

<p>If a condition of implicit confidence can
be established between you and the boy,
you can depend upon him to be receptive
of the good which you seek to charge him
with.</p>

<p>Then, with truth as his anchor, no storm
of the outer world can sweep him beyond
the influence of home. The bulwark of
the good character that you have builded
will stand throughout his lifetime.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a><br />
<small>A TALK AT CHRISTMAS TIME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On a Christmas Eve some thirty-odd
years ago a very small boy, guarded on
either side by sisters older than himself,
knelt at the low sill of his bedroom window
and looked wonderingly out into the
night. Above was the sky, studded with
twinkling stars. Below was a soft, silent
blanket of white—the unsullied snow of a
northern winter. Everything was very
still.</p>

<p>The boy looked first at the sky. Being
of the baby age when the children of the
wise are put to bed with the sun, the night
sky was more mystic than the snow.
There were so many of those stars, and
they appeared to be twinkling at him with
cheerful friendliness. One attracted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
particularly. It did not twinkle and was
not so merry as the others, but it was
larger and shone with a bright, steady
glow. It seemed to be reaching down
toward the boy as though it would speak
to him.</p>

<p>He recalled the story that had been told
him only the day before, the story of the
first Christmas and of three wise men
who had been guided to the manger
wherein lay the infant Christ; and the
thought came to him that this, perhaps,
was the star that led them. The suggestion
of the manger brought the boy’s eyes
downward to the snow-topped stable opposite
his window; and from the stable he
turned to the white-roofed houses with
their chimneys still smoking from the
evening fires. He wondered if Santa Claus
would have to wait till all the fires were
out before he could make his rounds.</p>

<p>How white everything was and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
still! A sense of delicious mystery crept
over him. He heard the sound of distant
sleigh-bells. They drew nearer and jingled
more tunefully. One of his guardians
caught his hand in hers and held up a
warning finger. They listened.</p>

<p>“Quick! Maybe it’s Santa Claus!”
whispered the guardians in unison; and
the three scampered to their beds and disappeared
beneath the blankets. Five
minutes later the little boy was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>The little boy was myself, and the incident
is the first Christmas that I can recall.
I recount it because it seems to
illustrate the natural coalescence of the
mythical idea with the historical idea of
the great world holiday.</p>

<p>Too often, I think, the real significance
of our holidays is lost in the merriment of
celebrating them. Every child is entitled
to a thorough explanation and a lasting impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the incident which Christmas
commemorates. In shaping the Christmas
idea in the boy’s mind we should begin at
the beginning. If the story of the Star
of Bethlehem is told in the right way and
at the right time, it may be depended upon
to survive the myths and the merry-making
with which the atmosphere is charged during
the festal period.</p>

<p>And this need not militate against the
development of the Santa Claus side of the
celebration, for the one amplifies the
other. Unselfish giving is the keynote to
both, and the child-mind easily comprehends
the application of the modern custom
to the ancient story.</p>

<p>In the bringing up of my boy I have
been a stickler for truth. Absolute confidence
between father and son, mother
and child, has been my plea and my practice,
always. Yet, while not going out of
my way to encourage the Santa Claus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
myth, I have most cheerfully tolerated it.
It is the one mystery of childhood that I
do not explain, and my reason for excepting
it from the calendar of candour is that
the end justifies the means.</p>

<p>I would not rob the boy of a fiction
that has not one harmful possibility, and
that brings so much gladness into the
home, and into his heart. I would not
deny him a kind of pleasure that added so
much to the joy of my own childhood.
But, and paramount to every other consideration,
the great unassailable justification
of the Santa Claus myth is the remarkable
lesson it teaches.</p>

<p>With reasonable reservations for the
unusual I may say that never, after the
Santa Claus age, does a man or a woman
either practise or experience that remarkable
unselfishness of the parents who conceal
their bounteousness behind a fiction.
After childhood we continue to give and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
take. We give to our brothers and sisters,
to our parents and to all whom we
love. It is our pleasure to add to their
happiness; but it is also our pleasure to
feel that they know it is we who have so
contributed to their enjoyment.</p>

<p>Not so in Santa Claus land. There,
and there only, is found the absolute submergence
of self, the sincerely impersonal
benefaction. As a child, coming down to
the dazzling Christmas tree, I said:
“How good is Santa Claus!” But in
after years when I began to realise that
every one of those trees of joy had come
from my good father, who had tramped
out into the woods to cut them and had
hauled them over the hills for miles, sometimes
through a blinding blizzard,—then
I said: “How great is a parent’s love!”</p>

<p>When the boy arrives at the age of
serious reasoning, say six or seven, and
asks me point-blank if there is really a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Santa Claus, I meet the question fairly.
I simply decline to answer and give him
my reason for so doing. I explain to him
that half the fun of the holiday lies in the
mystery surrounding St. Nicholas. I tell
him, good-humouredly but positively, that
he must solve the Santa Claus problem
himself.</p>

<p>By taking this position I keep square
with the boy, and at the same time he is
not disillusionised, for he is as willing to
cling to the romance as I am to have him—and
more so.</p>

<p>The custom, particularly prevalent in
the large cities, of conducting the boy
through the toy department of the stores
when the big holiday stocks are on display,
is to be deplored. The lavish exhibitions
paraded before his eyes cannot fail
to dull his appreciation of the home Christmas.</p>

<p>In arranging my boy’s Christmas I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
strive for simplicity. It was Nerissa, I
think, in the “Merchant of Venice,” who
said: “They are as sick who surfeit with
too much, as they that starve with nothing.”
The rich—sometimes—pity the
poor at Christmas.</p>

<p>This is well, for pity looses a purse-string
occasionally, and Heaven knows
there are enough tight ones! But the fact
is, that the children of the moderately
poor often get more real joy to a square
inch of a Christmas morning than many a
little brother of the rich. There can be
no great pleasure in receiving when there
has been no genuine longing. Only the
child who has known want can fully relish
realisation.</p>

<p>A few modest gifts, judiciously selected,
are more permanently satisfying than a
lavish display, indiscriminately gathered.
I always try to supply my boy with one
thing that he most desires, or with a fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
compromise between it and what I can
afford to buy. If I can meet his anticipations
fully in this one gift I do so; but it
must be something of a substantial and
permanent nature. After which, if my
purse permits, I amplify this with a few
things of lesser cost and more trivial in
character.</p>

<p>And here let me record a protest
against that modern unnecessary, the perfected
toy. By the perfected toy I mean
the toy that is not a plaything, but an ingenious
contrivance so perfected mechanically
that it leaves nothing for the child
to do. I protest against the toy that
leaves absolutely nothing to either the
fancy or the ingenuity of the boy. The
imaginative faculty of a child is constantly
reaching out for something upon which it
may feed and develop. This propensity
is stifled by the perfected toy. The railroad
outfit that goes into complete operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
at the turn of a lever; the doll that
walks and talks and has an elaborate
trousseau; the soldier equipments that fit
a boy out in military style from head to
toe—these and all like them are praiseworthy
examples of the commercial instinct
of the toymakers; but they do not
meet the requirements of the child.</p>

<p>And if the juvenile mind were capable
of self-analysis it would reject them. I
learned this first from a little girl of three
years. She had been deluged with presents
that Christmas morning; but before
an hour had passed she had looked them
all over, and we found her curled up in
an armchair, playing with a clothes-pin
and an empty baking-powder can! Hers
was the happiness found only in the land
of Make-Believe.</p>

<p>Instead of giving my boy a soldier outfit,
I would give him a pocket-knife—assuming
that he is old enough to wield one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Having a new knife, he is ambitious to use
it, and he fashions a sword out of a stick
of pine. The sword suggests playing soldier,
and he proceeds to make a peaked
hat out of a newspaper; a skate-strap answers
for a belt, and he makes a pair of
epaulets from a scrap of tin-foil. In this
way the boy is duly benefited: in creating
these things his ingenuity is drawn upon,
and, in supplying things that he cannot
make, his imagination is exercised.</p>

<p>One can hardly begin too early to teach
the child the pleasure of giving. A few
pennies taken by him from his own little
bank, and an excursion to a neighbouring
store, will initiate the idea. A mere
trinket for each member of the household
will serve the purpose and put him on the
right track. But we must go further than
the family circle with the Christmas idea.
We must show the boy that while charity
begins at home, it does not end there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>One day shortly before Christmas, I
took the boy to the closet where his discarded
toys were kept, and I said:</p>

<p>“There are millions of children in the
world, and there are not always toys
enough to go around. If you will tell me
which of these things you do not play with
any more, I will see that they are distributed
on Christmas Day among little
boys and girls who otherwise would get
nothing.”</p>

<p>He looked the things over carefully,
and said finally that there was nothing
that he would like to give away. I did
not urge the matter; but the next day I invited
him to take a ride with me on the
street-car. Alighting at City Hall Park,
we walked down the Bowery. Arriving at
Pell Street, I found Chuck Connors sunning
himself on the corner.</p>

<p>“Chuck,” I said, “I have a dollar in
my pocket that isn’t busy, and I want you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to take me to some one who needs it more
than you or me.”</p>

<p>So off we trudged, Chuck and I, and the
boy between. A few blocks farther down
we turned toward the river. It was familiar
ground to Chuck and me—but the
boy’s eyes were opened to a new world.
He saw the misery of the slums. He
passed a boy of his own age, barefooted—in
December—staggering under a load of
scrap-wood that would have troubled a
man to bear. He saw a little girl, half
clad, shivering behind an ash-can, trying
to hide herself from her drunken father,
who leered at the waif from a hallway
across the street. Pushing on into the
very heart of that pitiable section, through
poverty, want and wretchedness, the boy
went with us through a miserable tenement,
wherein the spectre of Starvation
stalked through the sordid halls and
snarled at my dollar bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>On the car, homeward bound, the boy
tugged at my elbow.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “besides what’s in
the closet, they’s a lot of other things I
don’t play with any more.”</p>

<p>Ever since then we have had an annual
house-cleaning about a week before Christmas,
and the Salvation Army wagon carries
away a goodly load. Indeed, the
event has come to be regarded as quite a
festal occasion.</p>

<p>As the years go on and the boy begins
to leave playland behind, I would not
hurry him into the realism of the grown-up’s
Yuletide. Let the charm of mystery,
of certainty, of anticipation, linger as long
as it will.</p>

<p>Perhaps last year you thought it was a
bit incongruous when you found yourself
slipping a safety razor into a gaily-hued
sock, size ten, dangling in the chimney-corner.
And perhaps you have decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that he is too big for that sort of thing
now, and that you will let it go by default
this Christmas. Maybe you are about to
tell him so.</p>

<p>My friend, defer it.</p>

<p>Stick right on in the old way as long as
you can get the boy to stick with you; for,
once you have severed the ties of the
Christmas of his childhood, you will have
cut the tinsel thread that links your son
to the only fairyland he will ever know.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V">V</a><br />
<small>THE DYNASTY OF THE DIME NOVEL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>My neighbour ran in at the basement door
as was his wont. Coming lightly up the
stairs he entered the library, and not finding
me there, but hearing a voice beyond,
he walked across the room and
looked in at the open doorway of my
den, where he stood for a moment, unobserved.</p>

<p>This is what he saw:</p>

<p>The boy, then scarcely nine, stretched
out comfortably on a sofa, reading aloud;
I reclining in an easy-chair with my
slippered feet in another, and listening
intently; a bright light shining over
the boy’s shoulder and flooding the
room.</p>

<p>My neighbour paused long enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
hear these words fall from the reader’s
lips in boyish monotone:</p>

<p>“The crack of a Winchester sounded
on the night air and the engineer fell
dead!”</p>

<p>Then he interrupted.</p>

<p>“Well, in the name of reason,” he
said, “what are you folks reading?”</p>

<p>The boy and I looked up. I took the
book from the youngster’s hand and
passed it up to the intruder.</p>

<p>“The life and adventures of Jesse
James,” I said.</p>

<p>My neighbour took the book gingerly,
read the title and glanced at the cover,
upon which were pictured in vivid colours
three desperate-looking gentlemen in
black masks, holding up a train.</p>

<p>“And you are reading this—together?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I; “taking turns at it, he
a chapter and I a chapter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>My neighbour shrugged his shoulders
and returned the volume, dusting his
fingers.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think he would get to this
sort of stuff soon enough—without you
helping him?”</p>

<p>“He arrived there to-day,” I said;
“and I’m there with him.”</p>

<p>There you have it—the great difference
of viewpoint: my neighbour looking at it
from where he stands and I looking at it
from the standpoint of my boy. My
neighbour convinced that I was starting
my beloved son on the highroad to a
criminal career; I calm and confident, and
cocksure that I am doing what is best for
the boy. And I guess if we were to take
the vote of Parenthood on the issue, my
side would go down to overwhelming defeat.</p>

<p>Now, my father says that up to the time
he departed from the parental roof there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
were only two books in the home that he
was permitted to read—the Bible and
Foxe’s “Martyrs.” From his tenth to his
seventeenth year he was actually starving,
he said, for the want of stories of
adventure. Once, when he was fourteen,
a departing visitor left a copy of “Scottish
Chiefs.” This he seized upon and
was devouring it in the attic when discovery
by his stern pater cut him off in
the middle of a most exciting battle. The
book was confiscated and he was soundly
chastised. “And do you know,” adds my
father ruefully, “it was three years before
I learned how that fight came out!”</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s why he gave me a freer
hand in my selections when I was a kid.
He did, anyway. All that he required was
that it must be free from any suggestion
of the obscene and of sacrilege. Like
most boys I began my independent reading
with “Grimm’s Fairy Tales,” “Robinson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Crusoe,” “Swiss Family Robinson,”
“Arabian Nights” and books of the sort
that boys usually receive as gifts. From
these I jumped to the nickel and dime
variety. There were one or two good
juvenile magazines coming into the home,
but they were not sufficient. I waded
through all the “Smart Aleck” books, including
“Peck’s Bad Boy.” I took the
thrills with the ten-cent detective heroes
of the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter type,
and revelled in the more or less historical
exploits of David Crockett, Kit Carson,
Daniel Boone and Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>At fourteen I had run the gamut of
cheap literature. I do not mean that I
read every “penny-dreadful” in existence,
for the list is endless—there is a new
one every day. But I had “got my skin
full” and the stuff began to pall. After
reading a good number of these books,
even a boy feels their want of the convincing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
quality. He feels, too, their sameness
and their unrealness.</p>

<p>Then I approached the modern style
and the truer type of boy books, stories of
the Alger, Oliver Optic and G. A. Henty
kind; and then the better type of adventure
stories, such as “Treasure Island”
and “King Solomon’s Mines.” Then I
drifted into Wilkie Collins’ creations,
reading only the more exciting ones—“The
Moonstone” and “The Dead
Alive.” After that came Edgar Allan
Poe and Charles Reade; and before I was
sixteen I had got into Scott, Thackeray
and Dickens. And here I anchored.
Since then, of course, I have voyaged far
and wide in all directions, but Dickens
is my snug harbour, and will be to the
end. No boy could revel—shall I say
wallow?—in trashy literature more than
I did; but search as I will, I cannot see
where it left a trace of an influence on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
conduct or my character. I do not think
it was owing to any want of physical
courage; because I know that I did my
share of fighting and took as many beatings
with a dry eye as the others; a little
more of both, in fact, than it would become
me to boast about. But I never
robbed a bank or had any desire to; I
never craved the career of a detective
keenly enough to try my hand at it, and
while at one time I did yearn for a chance
to battle single-handed with a band of
Sioux warriors, the desire never led me
into more dangerous quarters than a seat
at the Wild West Show. Was I different
from other boys? My mother says certainly
I was, and very much better. God
bless her! My father says I was about
like the rest. My teacher—he is a prominent
member of the New York bar now,
and I put the question to him squarely
just the other day—tells me frankly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
I was the worst boy in school. The three
estimates, averaged, would make me an
average boy, and I think my experience as
to the effect of reading material was
about the usual experience of boys in
general.</p>

<p>They pass through the age of blood-and-thunder
literature just as they have
mumps, measles and marbles, and are none
the better and but little the worse for having
gone through it. As water finds its
level, so the temperament eventually finds
its affinity in reading matter.</p>

<p>“There is no book so bad,” said the
elder Pliny, “but that some good might
be got out of it.”</p>

<p>I know that some boys who read cheap
literature go to the bad. But I have never
seen it established that the reading was
responsible for the waywardness. I do
not deny that, granting the existence of a
tendency toward a life of crime, certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
types of stories might encourage the tendency.
But the influence of this stuff is so
slight that the avoidance of it would not
prevent the downward step.</p>

<p>Many a boy, fascinated by the glamour
of the circus, has run away with one.
Still, this does not make the circus reprehensible
nor would I, because of that circumstance,
deny my boy the pleasure of
attending it. On the contrary, I go with
him to the circus and sit beside him. We
munch peanuts joyously, but I warn him to
beware of the red lemonade and tell him
why it is sometimes unwholesome. He
sees the show from start to finish—under
my direction. And when he has seen it I
reveal to him the reverse side of the picture—I
give him a peep behind the scenes.
I tell him of the hardships and privations
of a showman’s life, the long night rides,
the harsh discipline, the perils and dangers
of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>This is exactly my attitude toward the
boy’s early reading. I do not throw wide
open the doors of the paper-cover library
and push him into it. But if he shows a
desire to explore it, I go with him.
Wherever I can save him time and eyestrain
by a friendly suggestion, I am there
to make it. When I find him reading
“Cut-Throat Charley, the Terror of the
Spanish Main,” I do not pooh-pooh the
book or make sport of the boy. I do
tell him that the best pirate story ever
written is Stevenson’s “Treasure Island”
and tell him that if he wants a shipwreck
story that will make his hair stand up he
ought to read Poe’s “Arthur Gordon
Pym” or Reade’s “Foul Play.” Once he
has read either of these, you may depend
upon it that “Cut-Throat Charley” will
never ring true.</p>

<p>When he takes up Mr. Nicholas Carter
I suggest “The Mystery of the Rue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Morgue,” “Les Misérables” and “Sherlock
Holmes,” and other detective stories
of the better class.</p>

<p>My boy had been learning from other
boys something of the exploits of Jesse
James and asked me if I would get the
book. I agreed to it, readily. Somewhat
to my surprise I found that since my time
the list of James books had been increased
to thirty-six. Thirty-five of these
were “pot-boilers”; “Jesse James’
Nemesis,” “Jesse James’ Revenge,”
“Jesse James’ Long Chance,” “Jesse
James’ Mistake,” and so on. I passed
these over, of course, and invested fifteen
cents in “The James Boys, Jesse and
Frank,” which was the book I had read
when I was a youngster. It was a plain
record of the men’s exploits, compiled
from newspaper clippings of that period.
I explained to the boy that the others were
largely imaginative—unreal. We read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
book together. Then we read the story
of Cole Younger and his brothers and
later that of the criminal career of Harry
Tracy, the infamous outlaw of the Northwest.
Together we enjoyed the romance,
such as there was, of their exploits; together
we discussed the animal courage
and moral cowardice of their careers; and
together we followed them to the punishment
which they so richly deserved.</p>

<p>Had my boy evinced a desire to read
the remaining thirty-five James books, I
would not have restrained him, farther
than to suggest a change. It so happened
that when he had finished the three books
mentioned he had had enough of these distinguished
gentlemen and their ilk, and began
casting about in other directions.</p>

<p>So my message on the reading subject is,
don’t think that the boy’s craving for the
nickel library is an indication of depravity,
or that indulgence in it will start him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the road to perdition. The appetite for
these books is a normal one. It develops
at a time when his appreciation
of romance is in full bloom but while big
words, subtle phrasing and genuine ingenuity
are not yet within his comprehension.
It demands quick action and quick
results, stripped of the artistic setting and
higher polish which are demanded by the
refinement of matured intellect.</p>

<p>Do not regard this kind of reading as
a menace to the boy’s morals, but as a
stepping-stone to something better and
more beneficial. Do not, either by rule or
ridicule, drive the boy from his home to
seek it, but stay with him and guide him
through it. Keep him well supplied with
good books and good magazines that approach,
as nearly as you can judge, the
requirement of his fancy. Watch him,
but do not worry him. Have the better
things at hand and accessible and point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the way to them. Rest assured that in
due time Cut-Throat Charley will have
lost his charm, and a hero more worthy
of emulation will stand in his shoes.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a><br />
<small>THE SIN OF SEX SECRECY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Let us suppose that our country has become
involved in a war. At the edge of
your town a battle rages. You can hear
the roar of cannon and clash of steel as
columns of men fall in their blood, cut
down by the flashing sabres and flying
canister. Re-enforcements are hurrying
to the scene. Up the street comes a regiment
of soldiers with flags waving, drums
beating and arms gleaming in the sunshine.
Your son, your boy, standing in the doorway,
laughs and cheers as they approach.
The band strikes up a lively air. The boy
beats time with his feet, starts, hesitates
and then, with a wave of his cap, falls in
line with the gay procession and marches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
joyously toward the scene of death and
carnage.</p>

<p>Madam, at such a moment what would
you do? Would you sit calmly at your
window and see him go innocently, blindly
on to the danger that you knew lay just beyond
the turn of the road?</p>

<p>Would you not fly to his side and draw
him back and hold him tight in your arms?
And if he were big and strong and insistent,
though still your boy, would you
not at least tell him that war is not all
music and drum-beats and bright uniforms?
Would you not warn him of its
dangers, of its horrors? If he must go
and you could not hold him, would you let
him go unwarned of its realities—and unarmed?</p>

<p>Well, there is a war in progress—in our
country, in your town; a war more terrible,
more revolting than any chronicled in history.
The youth of America are marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
toward the battleground, and the
splendid column is passing your window
now, to-day and every day. Perhaps you
do not see the conflict yourself, for the
battlefield is always just around the
corner.</p>

<p>As sure as you have a son, just so sure
will he some day turn that corner. Just so
sure will he some day stand on your doorstep,
and feel the lure of the passing
show, and just so sure will he some time
be drawn into the conflict, when he will
have to fight his way through as best he
can. At six he is in your arms; at sixteen
he will be on the firing-line; at twenty-six
the ordeal will have passed and the battle
will have been lost or won. Can you
then look backward into the past and feel
that you had warned and fortified him?</p>

<p>I can. Whatever may be in store for
my boy, he goes to meet it with more than
my prayers—he has, also, a full knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of life’s mysteries. He shares with
me a thorough understanding of the evils
that may beset him. If my affectionate
admonitions can help him, he has them;
if my mistakes of the past serve as danger
signals along his pathway, he knows of
them; if my longer experience and broader
knowledge of the world’s ways can save
him, he shall escape the snares and pitfalls
that await the heedless step of the
untaught and untold young.</p>

<p>Before he was seven I had told him
whence we come. Scraps of conversation
overheard on the street between his own
playfellows warned me that the time had
come and made my duty clear. I saw the
pity of it! My boy, whom I had taught
to look trustfully to me for the truth at
all times and about all things; my boy
hearing distorted and vulgarised bits of
knowledge that should have come to him
solemnly and sacredly from the parent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
whom he had learned to look upon as the
fountainhead!</p>

<p>This is what I told him:</p>

<p>“God made everything, as you know.
He made the sea and the land, the sky
and the stars and the sun and the moon.
He makes the trees and the plants and
the animals and the boys and the girls
who grow to be men and women. But
when I say God makes these things I do
not mean that He makes them with tools,
as you would make a playhouse, or with
His hands, as you would make a snow-man.
He makes all of these things by a great
plan which He has laid out and by which
all things, with His help, spring up and
grow, over and over again, so that the
world may go on just as it is for years
and years. By this plan all living things
come from a seed. This seed is within all
grown-up plants and grown-up animals.
When a new plant is needed, a seed falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
from the grown-up plant and falls into
the soil, where it sprouts and becomes a
young plant. Every kind of animal is
composed of two sexes, the male sex and
the female sex. The fathers are of the
male sex; the mothers of the female sex.
As the seed of plants is within the flower,
so the seed of animals is within the
mother animal. When a new animal is
needed the seed within the mother slowly
grows into a young animal like the father
or mother, and while it is still very small
it comes out into the light and sunshine;
and that is what we mean when we say it is
born. Men and women are animals.
They are different from all other animals
in that they can talk and think and are
much higher and better in every way.
But the seed forms within the mother just
as it does within the plants and birds and
animals of all kinds. And when another
child is needed the seed begins to grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and takes the form of a little child and
after awhile it comes into the world to be
dressed and fed and cared for; that is
what we mean when we say that a babe has
been born. That is how you came into
the world and how I came and how all
of us came. It is all a part of God’s
wonderful plan to keep the world growing
greater and better and more beautiful.
It is not good for boys to talk about
these beautiful things in a rough way, and
I hope you will not do so. I tell them to
you because I want you to know the truth.
If there is anything you do not understand,
ask me and I will explain it. Whatever
you may hear, no matter whether it is
good or bad, if you want to know the
truth about it come to me and I will tell
you.”</p>

<p>That was all. Science in words of two
syllables. Science is truth, and truth is
what your boy demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>My boy took me at my word. He
came back for further enlightenment
more than once. But every time I answered
him soberly, freely and truthfully.
And when he knew everything he was
immune to that contamination which mystery
breeds. And what is more, the
parent had measured up to the child’s
ideal. The father was still the fountainhead;
and no boy will drink from the
stagnant pool of vulgarity when the clear
crystal water of truth is close at hand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Revealing the science of propagation
to the child-boy is, after all, only the first
step toward unfolding the many facts of
sex—facts that are made mysteries
through the inexcusable selfishness—or
modesty, if you prefer to call it that—of
mothers and fathers. If sealing the
secrets of sex is an injustice to the boy of
six, it is a scarlet sin against the youth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
sixteen. At six he is looking at life curiously
from the family dooryard—within
the mother’s call; but at sixteen or soon
thereafter, he strides out into the street,
marches down the highway and turns the
corner. He is on the firing-line. Now
comes a crisis in the boy’s life so acute,
so grave that I approach the subject with
trepidation. My poor pen, tempered by
that delicacy demanded of printed words,
seems incapable of the task before me.
And I approach it also with reverence
because I look upon it as an almost divine
privilege to be permitted to discuss with
an army of mothers a problem which I
regard as the great tragedy of American
youth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nature is good, Nature is provident,
but above all Nature is self-preservative.
Go to your naturalists, your entomologists,
and they will all tell you that the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
perpetuation is first and foremost among
all living things. Man is no exception.
Your boy, just coming into his maturity, is
in this respect like unto all other growing
things that God has made. As he ripens
toward manhood this instinct becomes
more manifest within him. Vaguely, perhaps,
he recognises its import, but in the
main it is a mystery. In a general way
he may reason out its purpose; but how
can he know its humanised limitations?
How can he know that the refining
process of civilisation has demanded a
check upon the exercise of Nature’s functions?
And—here is the vital issue—how
shall he know of the dread penalties Nature
sometimes exacts when these restraints
are violated? Why is it that the
loving father and mother, who labour with
him and watch over him and shield him
through childhood, decline to raise a finger
of warning against the grim spectre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
disease that stalks behind the painted faces
of the underworld? Must it be written,
to the shame of human parenthood, that
the very horror of this evil stays the
warning hand? Or does the mother fall
into that too common error of thinking
that this evil of evils is open to every
boy but her own? Then listen to this,
which I quote from an eminent authority:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Take a group of one hundred young
men—those from eighteen to twenty-five
years of age—and seventy-five of these
will be found to be suffering either from
the effects of venereal diseases or still in
an acute stage of one of them.”</p></div>

<p>Mothers, let not your eyes be blinded
to a condition that medical records have
proven to be a fact. It may be your boy
and it may be mine.</p>

<p>The chances of its being mine are reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to the minimum—<em>because my boy
will know</em>. The revelation, as I make it,
is so simple and yet so complete, that it
could be accomplished with equal ease by
mother or father. When he is about sixteen
I place in his hand a book that tells
him all, and I say to him: “My boy, when
you are alone, read this.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There are
truths in it which you should know.”
From that hour the “great social peril”
must fight my son in the open. He knows
all that science can teach—all that parents
can tell.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noi"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> There are several good books designed for this
purpose. “Confidential Chats with Boys,” and
“Plain Facts on Sex Hygiene,” are two in a series
on this subject by Wm. Lee Howard, M.D., and
published by E. J. Clode, 156 Fifth Avenue, New York.</p></div>

<p>I am going to say now what I should
have said at the outset—that the father,
though he may leave every other phase
of the boy’s development to the mother,
should take the initiative in sex enlightenment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
He should regard it as his peculiar
right, his sacred privilege, to point
out the devious paths through which he
himself may have threaded his way from
youth to man’s estate. There are no barriers
between me and my boy. The oneness
of affection and the sameness of sex
easily compass the disparity in years. He
grows older but I do not, for I am waiting
for him. In fact I am going back to him—I
am meeting him halfway. Our play is
as boy with boy. Our talks are as man to
man.</p>

<p>In a relationship like this there are no
“sex secrets.” There is no ice to break,
because the transmission of knowledge is
consistent, gradual and unconscious. But
when the father fails in his duty and the
mother has to step into the breach, it is
different, I concede. There is a certain
reserve which is womanly, and perhaps
not unmotherly. Still, mother’s love is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
poor thing if it cannot break down that
slender wall to save the boy. And
mother’s love is not a poor thing, but a
great power. So if mothers can only be
made to see why it must be done, and when
and how, I believe they will do it.</p>

<p>This is an appeal not to parental love
only, but to parental reason. It is made
not by a purist, but by one who has travelled
the road by which all boys must go,
and who knows its every crook and turn.
It is a plea in behalf of the American boy,
who asks only that he be given a torch
to light his way.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a><br />
<small>THE WEED AND THE WINECUP</small></h2>
</div>


<p>In the past fiscal year there were smoked
in the United States nearly two million
cigarettes more than in any previous year
of the nation’s history; and the consumption
of distilled spirits, exclusive of wines
and beers, broke the record of the preceding
year by twenty-three million gallons.</p>

<p>Now, there is nothing particularly remarkable
about these figures except as
they signify that we, as a nation, are
smoking and drinking considerably more
than we used to, which in turn suggests
the question: To what extent are our boys
responsible for the increase? I’m sure I
don’t know, and I can’t see any way of
finding out. But I do know, from daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
observation, that the tobacco and strong
drink habits are formed in boyhood more
commonly than there is any need of. I
do know that a great many young men acquire
a taste for cigarettes and whiskey
while yet in their teens, purely through
lack of the proper parental influence and
instruction.</p>

<p>To me this seems pitiable, especially
because it is so obviously unnecessary.
The parents’ duty is clear. It is amenable
to a hard and fast rule to which there
need be no exception, from which there
should be no deviation. The boy should
be made to abstain from liquor and tobacco
until he is twenty-one.</p>

<p>How can you keep him from them?
Facts, logic, reason. By these means and
only these, can you get the boy on the
right track and be sure that he will stick.
Threats, coercion, exaggerations, bribes
or pleadings will accomplish nothing dependable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
At this stage in his career you
can tell him what to do, but you must also
tell him why.</p>

<p>A lady once said to me: “You believe
that the parent should live according to
the principle he teaches the child. Then,
how can you deny your son tobacco, with
a lighted cigar between your lips?”</p>

<p>The answer to this brings us to the nib
of the tobacco question. The child is put
to bed at seven o’clock, although the
parents may not retire until eleven. The
child takes milk at breakfast and the
parents may have coffee. The father may
devote ten hours of the day to work, but
this would not be well for the child.
Many things that the man may do with
impunity are not good for the growing
boy.</p>

<p>This is exactly what I tell my boy, and
he sees the logic of it: While a boy is
growing he should take nothing into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
system that is not nutritious and he should
particularly abstain from anything that
may retard the development of his bodily
organs, even in the slightest degree.
Every pulsation of the heart, every expansion
of the lung cells, every function
of the nerves must do its work unimpeded
while the frame is lengthening and broadening
into the proportions of a man.
Once the frame is completely developed
the organs merely have to renew the old
tissues. But during the growing period
they have not only to renew the old but to
create additional flesh, blood and bone to
meet the demands of the increasing bulk.
There are two chemicals in tobacco,
pyridine and nicotine, that have a restraining
effect upon the heart, lungs and
nerves. If you give them the additional
burden of carrying off these two poisonous
chemicals, the building up of the tissues
is sure to suffer. If you do not feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
bad results from it in youth, you will certainly
feel them in later years.</p>

<p>Said my boy to me: “I know a chap
who smokes cigarettes; and he does a
hundred yards in eleven seconds.”
“That’s too bad,” said I, “for just so
sure as he does it in eleven seconds with
the cigarette handicap, he could do it in
ten and a half without it. And if this boy
is running for an organised athletic department
like that of a college or an
established club, the training rules will
forbid him the use of tobacco for a certain
period before the day of the contests.
Ask any athletic coach about tobacco and
he will tell you to ‘cut it out.’ Ask any
physician about it—even one who is himself
a smoker—and he will tell you that
no matter how strong and well a growing
youth who smokes may be, he would be a
good degree stronger and better if he did
not use tobacco. You would like to arrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
at manhood, as nearly physically perfect
as you can, wouldn’t you? You have not
as yet acquired a taste for tobacco, have
you? Well, then, do you not see that by
abstaining from it you have something to
gain and absolutely nothing to lose? Let
tobacco alone until you are twenty-one.
I might better say twenty-five, for that is
the accepted age of maturity. But we will
put it at twenty-one and perhaps by that
time you will add a few years’ more abstinence
of your own volition.”</p>

<p>Mothers, do not go beyond facts in
pleading against the cigarette. Do not
tell your boy that cigarettes contain opiates,
because they do not. I have been
through dozens of cigarette factories and
have followed the process of manufacture
from the raw leaf to the finished article.
The better grades contain absolutely nothing
but pure tobacco of the mildest kind.
In the cheaper grades a little harmless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
glycerine is sometimes used to relieve the
harsh taste of the tobacco. No harmful
drugs are employed. The paper wrappers
are purer and less irritating than the
tobacco. Cigarette paper is the purest
paper manufactured. The danger of the
cigarette is, first, that its cheapness appeals
to the boy who would not think of
buying cigars; and second, its very mildness
encourages the young man to
increase his smoking until he drifts into
excessiveness without knowing it. Consumed
in moderation, it is the least harmful
form in which tobacco is used. But
cigarettes or cigars, or tobaccos in any
shape whatever, are not good for the
growing boy.</p>

<p>Mothers, this is the truth about tobacco,
and this is what you should tell your boy.
Do not say that cigarette smoking leads to
the penitentiary or the madhouse, because
it doesn’t, and the boy knows better. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
principal of my boy’s school walks by every
day with a cigar in his mouth. He is near
seventy and a good citizen. Do not say
tobacco creates an appetite for strong
drink, because it is not true, and the boy
will not believe it. Do not say that smoking
wrecks the nervous system, because in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it does
nothing of the sort, and the boy, who is
constantly observing the man, will not be
convinced. Tell him the plain truth as
I have written it, and he will see the consistency
of your reasoning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Strong drink is no relative of tobacco.
The only similitude between the subjects
is that they are both unnecessaries, if I
may coin the word, to the boy’s career.
I have little to say about strong drink,
because, while it is a matter of vital importance
to the boy, it is a problem which
our mothers appear to have pretty well in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hand. The great majority, I believe, proceed
on the theory that alcohol is not
good for anybody, is ruinous to many,
and, therefore, should be kept out of the
home and away from the boy. There are
a minority, however, who reason differently—thuswise:
That drink is not harmful
except to those who make it so by
excessive use; that the boy who is carefully
guarded against it in the home will
the easier fall a victim to it when he gets
beyond the home influence and the home
restraint; and, <i>per contra</i>, that the boy
who is permitted to become familiar with
the use of it moderately in the home, will
acquire temperance at the same time and
be the better fitted to combat with its attending
evils when he eventually goes out
into the world.</p>

<p>To the majority first mentioned I have
but this to say: Go on; you are doing well.</p>

<p>But to this minority I want to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Stop! For the love of the God who made
you, stop! You are on the wrong track.
And I’ll tell you why.</p>

<p>If alcoholism were only a habit, like the
use of tobacco, there might be a thread of
practicability in your line of reasoning.
But alcoholism is more than a habit—it is
a disease. There are alcoholic wards in
the hospitals, there are sanitariums devoted
exclusively to persons afflicted with
it, there are physicians who specialise in
the treatment of it. Some people are
immune to it; others are not. I am, it so
happens, and perhaps you are—but is your
boy?</p>

<p>Science has lately ascertained that none
are born consumptives. Some may be born
with a tendency for the disease, or they
may be born without that tendency and
subsequently acquire the disease. The
same is true of alcohol.</p>

<p>I have no reason to believe that my boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
would be particularly susceptible to tuberculosis.
Nevertheless, I do not propose
to expose him to it. His window is kept
open while he sleeps, he is encouraged to
spend much time out of doors, he is given
breathing exercises daily, he is taught to
take precautions against infection when
near any one afflicted with the disease.</p>

<p>Nor have I any grounds for believing
that my boy has inherited the condition
that develops alcoholism. Looking back
into his ancestry, I find some non-abstainers
but no drunkards. I, his father, am absolutely
immune to it. Neither a total
abstainer nor, in my youth, even a temperatist,
I have walked arm in arm with it,
but found nothing to attract or allure.</p>

<p>But does this justify me in deliberately
exposing my boy to it?</p>

<p>I do not know how he is equipped for it
and there is no way of ascertaining. You
can take your boy to the doctor and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
will tell you whether or not his condition
is favourable to consumption. But alcoholism
is more insidious. Physicians
can diagnose it but they cannot foretell or
forestall it. There are some sanitariums
for alcoholism, but there are no preventoriums.</p>

<p>“But,” I am told, “if it is in him it will
come out sometime. Might it not better
show itself under the watchful eye of the
parents, rather than after the boy has
gone out from the home?”</p>

<p>If it is in the boy, then every year that
will put breadth to his shoulders, brawn
on his arm, pride in his heart, judgment
into his head and force into his character,
makes him better able to cope with the
disease. No, no, a thousand times no!
Do not have on your soul the guilt of giving
your boy his first taste of wine.</p>

<p>We must consider latent alcoholism as
a possibility in bringing up our boys. Remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
alcoholism is not a habit only,
but also a disease. It is much more prevalent
than smallpox, but for alcoholism
there is no vaccine; science offers no preventive
serum. It is your sacred duty,
then, to prevent the contact, to keep out
the contagion until your son has his full
growth and strength, and it is your duty
to tell him the situation as I have outlined
it, so that he may know the real danger
of rum.</p>

<p>Then, if the tendency is not in him,
nothing has been lost, and if it is in him,
you have brought him to man’s estate
well equipped to give the evil a fair fight
for supremacy.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br />
<small>OUT INTO THE WORLD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>A young man of my acquaintance, who
had just finished his schooling, came to
his father one morning, flushed with
pride, and holding an open letter in his
hand.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, “I’ve got a situation,
and the man says I may start to work
in the morning.”</p>

<p>The father took the letter and read it.</p>

<p>“Do you know all about this man?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Do I know him? Why, no; I don’t
know him at all. But he knows all
about <em>me</em>. He looked up all my references.”</p>

<p>“Of course he did,” replied the father,
putting the letter into his pocket; “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
before you go to work for him I’m going
to look up <em>his</em>.”</p>

<p>It was a homely, up-state father who
said that, but he was a wise and a good
man and I revere him. He was a father
who knew the boy from the skin in. He
knew that the boy’s first employer is, in
the boy’s eyes, the greatest man in the
world. He perceived that his son, who
for twenty years had looked upon him,
the father, as the man of men, was about
to have set before him a new pattern, a
new ideal. And out of his heart came the
question:</p>

<p>“What is this man like?”</p>

<p>It is a fine thing to know that you have
brought your boy through that plastic
period between his cradle-hood and his
majority, and to know when he comes of
age that he is clean and straight and true.
It must be gratifying indeed, when the last
text-book is closed and laid away, to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
him start into the world, a man grown,
with keen aspirations and high ideals,
ready and eager to grapple with the
world on his own account, and capable
of taking care of himself with his own
hands.</p>

<p>If you have brought him through safely
to this momentous hour, you have done
much. But is your task quite ended?
Does your responsibility stop here?</p>

<p>That up-state father whom I have just
referred to thought that it did not; and I
agree with him. I believe that the father
and mother yet have that one last touch
to give to the character they have helped
to form. I believe it is their duty to see,
not that the boy has a good situation, but
that he starts under a good man.</p>

<p>Naturally, the employer, in most cases,
is a man who has met with some success in
his business or his profession. He sits
apart from his subordinates. However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
much they may use their ingenuity, it is he
who shapes the policy of the business and
dominates the concern. Every one about
him defers to him. Everything that is
done is subject to his approval. He is, in
fine, the head and front of the entire
establishment. There are clerks and
salesmen and accountants and confidential
advisers in the place, some with long experience
and grey hairs, but none are as
great as he, and all look up to the place he
occupies as a position worthy of aspiring
to.</p>

<p>The youth enters the employ of this
man fresh from school or college. Here
he gets his first insight of the career he
intends to follow. If the employer is a
good man, a man of high principles, all is
well. But if he is a man of sharp practices,
the boy is in danger. Having no
other standard of comparison in business
life, he may fall into the error of accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
his employer as a true type of the
successful man. He has come to this
place in a receptive frame of mind. Here
the foundation of his chosen career is to
be laid. Is it not probable that he will
absorb something of the morals of his
superior, even though they may not agree
with the higher ideals raised in the home?
When the boy first strikes out he is, after
all, only a fledgling. The family nest has
been feathered with love and care and
kindness and protecting influences. You
have told him of the outside world and
you have tried to give him a clear vision.
But there are some things about flying
alone that only experience can teach.
You cannot always extend the home atmosphere
beyond the home, but you can
do something akin to it. You can make
it your business to see that his first glimpse
into the new life reveals nothing contrary
to the morals of the home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>You can see to it that his first employer
is the kind of man you would be satisfied
to have your son emulate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the selection of the boy’s calling it is
admitted, of course, that the boy himself
is, in a large measure, the best judge.
The vocation that he inclines to most
strongly is likely to be the one for which
he is best fitted. I think, however, that
this rule is made too elastic at times.</p>

<p>A young man of my acquaintance
thought that the stage was his calling.
The father, telling me of it in confidence,
said that in his, the father’s opinion, the
boy was best suited to the law, but added
that he would say nothing, believing it to
be a matter for the young man to decide
alone. The young man had an exceptionally
good memory, a fine speaking voice
and the gift of oratory in a remarkable
degree. He was much of a student, prepossessing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in appearance and magnetic in
personality.</p>

<p>That was ten years ago and the young
man has never risen above mediocrity—and
he never will. He lacked one essential
to the drama—imagination. The
truth is that he should have gone into the
law. He saw the mistake in course of
time, and told me so, but it was too late.
Time had elapsed and he could not turn
back.</p>

<p>The boy is not always a good self-analyst.
He is too prone to measure his
talents perfunctorily. It does not follow
that your son’s calling is art because he
can chalk a caricature on the wall; that he
should be a poet because he can dash off
a sentiment in rhyme; that he is suited to
the clergy because he is of a pious turn
of mind. It does not always follow that
the thing he does the most easily he can do
the best. This is the mistake that parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
must guard against when the time comes
for choosing a profession for the boy.</p>

<p>They have studied the boy from infancy,
while he has studied himself but little,
and that with an immatured mind. Is it
unlikely, then, that the parents often
know his latent capabilities better than
he himself knows them? It goes without
saying that the son shall not be driven
by parental authority into a profession
that is distasteful to him; but I think in
most cases the parents can aid the boy in
finding the true thread of his bent. With
no attempt at coercion they can help him
to accurately analyse those natural leanings
which, in the embryo, are many times
conflicting and misleading. It appears to
me that the counsel of the parents is needed
at this time no less than at any other
period in the boy’s life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having seen the boy well reared and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
started in the career for which he is best
equipped, and under the direction of a
superior whose influence will be uplifting,
I think the parents may rest in that peace
and tranquillity of mind that comes with
the consciousness of a duty well done.
They may now sit quietly by and watch
while the boy works.</p>

<p>I would caution them against expecting
too much of him. Of the million-and-a-half
of American boys born every year,
all cannot be famous—all cannot be rich.
Only a few can be President of the United
States. But all can be good citizens, and
that is the kind of material that the country
needs. We have plenty of great men,
and too many very rich men. A great
man is merely a good man picked haphazard
from thousands of others just as
good—picked by Opportunity whenever
the occasion demands. A rich man is one
who has more money than he needs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Either of these, beyond a certain stage of
self-progress, is a child of chance.</p>

<p>What you have a right to expect from
your son, if you have trained him conscientiously,
is success. I do not mean the
success that is measured by the dollar
sign, or by the size of the type in which
the newspapers print his name.</p>

<p>The successful man, in the true sense of
the word, is the law-abiding citizen who
gives unto the world enough of his brain
and brawn to pay the way of himself and
his family through it.</p>

<p>I believe there is the making of such
a man in every healthy boy that is born
into the civilised world. I believe that
every healthy boy is brought into the world
a good boy. If one of these develops
into a bad boy it is because he is made to;
not affirmatively, but negatively—through
the want of proper training. All the boy
needs is to be treated as a boy. He is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a god, to be worshipped, or a girl, to be
coddled, or a dog, to be driven. The boy
that I know is a sturdy little human being,
distinctly masculine in gender, with a desire
to be doing something and a want of
direction; in fine, an embryotic man.</p>

<p>Give him the light, tell him the truth,
show him the way. Do this consistently,
conscientiously, and he will measure up to
the highest standard of good citizenship.</p>

<p>More than this I do not ask of my boy.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
